## Assignment 1: Hand Gesture Detection for Rock-Paper-Scissor Game
In this assignment is a computer vision application to detect hand gestures. Main focus is on recognizing three gestures: Rock, Paper, and Scissor. This involves downloading the dataset, preprocessing the images, building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
