# Embedded-Machine-Learning-for-Edge-Computing-Course

This is a Repository Includes Assignments and Projects done in this Course

## Assignment 1: Hand Gesture Detection for Rock-Paper-Scissor Game
In this assignment is a computer vision application to detect hand gestures. Main focus is on recognizing three gestures: Rock, Paper, and Scissor. This involves downloading the dataset, preprocessing the images, building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Assigement 3: Motion Detection Using Edge Impulse
This project involves building a motion recognition system that runs on a microcontroller using machine learning. The system identifies four movements: Idle, Snake, Wave, and Updown, using data processed through Edge Impulse.
